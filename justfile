# Fetched rather than vendored, but at most once a day: this is a dependency of
# `format-staged`, which the pre-commit hook runs on every commit, so an
# unconditional fetch would put GitHub on the commit path.
#
# `-f` is load-bearing. Without it curl exits 0 on a 404 and writes the error body
# into the config file, and swiftformat then reformats the whole tree against
# `404: Not Found` from inside the pre-commit hook — silently, since the hook
# stays green. Verified.
